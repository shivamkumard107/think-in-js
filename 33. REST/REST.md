## Representational State Transfer

Representational state transfer (REST) is a **software architectural style** that describes a uniform interface between physically separate components, often across the Internet in a client-server architecture. 

> => **Representational** mean data. JSON or XML is used in REST
> => **State**: client can change the state of the resource using methods(GET, POST, DELETE) over a protocol(http, https)
> => **Transfer**: Data can be exchanged between client/server over a protocol called HTTP or HTTPs

###### Other Architecture Styles
1. SOAP
2. RPC
3. GRPC
4. GraphQL

> Services following REST architecture is a RESTful service.  

> API implementing REST is a REST API
