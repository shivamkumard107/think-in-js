Use any editor to view and edit these notes but I suggest to use obsidian as there will be some added benefits
1. Several plugins which I used for **formatting** will only work in Obsidian (in .obsidian files)
2. You will be missing out on all the **.canvas** file. Obsidian canvas is awesome. 
3. and the Obsidian **Graph View** ðŸ¤¤
