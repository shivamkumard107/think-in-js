# Think In JS

Use any editor to view and edit these notes but I suggest to use *Obsidian* as there will be some benefits
1. Several plugins which I used for **formatting** will only work in Obsidian (in .obsidian files)
2. You will be missing out on all the **.canvas** file. Obsidian canvas is awesome. 
3. and the Obsidian **Graph View** ðŸ¤¤

### Graph View

### Canvas

## Obsidian Settings
1. Theme: Things
2. Community Plugin: Advanced Tables, Juggl

> PS: Feel free to fork & building your notes upon it.
