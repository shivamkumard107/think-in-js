#### Advantages
- **Cost friendly –**
- **Easy to use –**
- **High scalability –**

#### Disadvantages
-   **Slow access time –**   
Direct access of files is very difficult and one needs to know the entire hierarchy of folders to get to a specific file. This involves a lot of time.   
 
-   **Presence of redundant data –**   
The same data can be present in two or more files which takes up more disc space.   
 
-   **Inconsistent Data –**  
Due to data redundancy, same data stored at different places might not match to each other.   

-   **Data Integrity Problems –**  
The data present in the database should be consistent and correct. To achieve this, the data should must satisfy certain constraints.  

-   **Difficulty in recovery of corrupt data –**   
Recovery or backup of lost and corrupt data is nearly impossible in case of File Processing System. 

-   **Lack of Atomicity –**  
Operations performed in the database must be atomic i.e. either the operation takes place as a whole or does not take place at all.   
 
-   **Problem in Concurrent Access –**   
When a number of users operates on a common data in database at the same time then anomalies arise, due to lack of concurrency control.
-   **Unauthorized Access –**
