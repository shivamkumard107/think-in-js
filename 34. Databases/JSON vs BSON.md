[**BSON**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bson/) is just binary JSON (a superset of JSON with some more data types, most importantly binary byte array). It is a serialization format used in MongoDB.

| Broadly JSON comprises of question and cluster where the question could be a collection of key-value sets and the cluster is a requested list of values. | The parallel encoding method comprises extra data such as lengths of strings and the protest subtypes. In addition, BinData and Date information sorts are the information sorts that are not upheld in JSON. |
