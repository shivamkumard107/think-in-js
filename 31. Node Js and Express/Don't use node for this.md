> Not Ideal for CPU-intensive task. CPU-intensive and heavy computing tasks

Node.js is a runtime environment that is designed for building scalable, networked applications. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it particularly well-suited for handling asynchronous operations and I/O-bound tasks, such as handling multiple client connections simultaneously or managing file I/O operations. However, there are a few reasons why Node.js is not recommended for CPU-intensive tasks:

1. **Single-threaded nature:** Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop. While this design is excellent for handling asynchronous tasks, it becomes a limitation when dealing with CPU-intensive tasks. Since Node.js can only execute one task at a time on a single thread, CPU-intensive tasks can block the event loop and prevent other tasks, including I/O operations, from being executed efficiently. This can lead to poor overall application performance and responsiveness.

2. **Blocking behavior:** CPU-intensive tasks in Node.js can cause the event loop to be blocked for an extended period, causing delays in handling other tasks. As Node.js relies on non-blocking I/O operations to achieve high concurrency, any blocking operation can negate these benefits and lead to reduced performance.

3. **Resource contention:** CPU-intensive tasks require a significant amount of processing power. When running such tasks in a Node.js application, the entire available CPU time is consumed by that task, leaving limited resources for other tasks. This can result in decreased responsiveness and the inability to efficiently handle other concurrent tasks.

4. **Inefficiency compared to compiled languages:** Node.js uses JavaScript, an interpreted language, which can be less efficient for CPU-bound operations compared to compiled languages like C++, Java, or Rust. Compiled languages can optimize code for better CPU utilization, resulting in improved performance for CPU-intensive tasks.

5. **Scalability limitations:** Since Node.js operates on a single thread, it may not fully utilize multi-core processors that are common in modern systems. This can limit its scalability for CPU-bound tasks that could potentially benefit from parallel processing.
