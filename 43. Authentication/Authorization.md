Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the **necessary permissions to access a particular resource** or perform a particular action. This involves checking the user's role or group membership and comparing it against the permissions that have been granted to that role or group. The purpose of authorization is to control what actions a user can perform on a resource and to prevent unauthorized access.
