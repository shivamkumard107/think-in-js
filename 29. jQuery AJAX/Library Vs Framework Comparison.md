[[Library]]
[[Framework]]

| **Parameters** | **Library** | **Framework** |
| ----------- | --------|-----------|
|Definition |Libraries provide developers with predefined functions and classes to make their work easier and boost the development process.| Framework, on the other hand, is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms.
| Inversion of Control | By using a library, you can control the flow of the application and call the library. | In contrast, when you use a framework, the control is inverted, i.e., the framework controls the flow and calls your code. |
| Examples | JQuery, React JS, etc. | Spring, NodeJS, AngularJS, Vue JS, etc. |
