Debouncing is another technique used in rate limiting to control the rate at which events or actions are executed. In JavaScript, debouncing can be used to limit the rate at which functions are called by **delaying the execution of the function until a certain amount of time has passed** since the last call. Here's an example of how debouncing can be used for rate limiting:

```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function(...args) {
    if (timeoutId) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    }
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}

const debouncedFunc = debounce(makeRequest, 1000);

function makeRequest() {
  // Make the request
}

// Call the debounced function
debouncedFunc();
```

In this example, the debounce() function takes a function and a delay as arguments. It returns a new function that can be called to execute the original function, but only after a delay specified by the delay argument has passed since the last call.

The timeoutId variable keeps track of the timeout that is set when the debounced function is called. When the debounced function is called again before the timeout has elapsed, the previous timeout is cancelled using the clearTimeout() function, and a new timeout is set with the updated arguments.

In this example, the makeRequest() function is called through the debouncedFunc variable, which is created by passing the makeRequest function and a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to the debounce() function. This ensures that the makeRequest() function is only called once, after a delay of 1 second, even if the debouncedFunc() is called multiple times during that period. This effectively limits the rate of requests being made.
