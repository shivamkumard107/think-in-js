Event-based communication is a communication pattern commonly used in microservice architecture, where services interact with each other by exchanging asynchronous events. Instead of direct request-response interactions, services **publish events** when certain actions or changes occur, and other **services subscribe to** these events to react accordingly.

#### Advantages
1. Conceptually easy to understand
2. Loose coupling
3. Scalability
4. Resilience: If a service is temporarily unavailable, events can be stored and processed later
5. Flexibility
6. Event sourcing and auditing


#### Disadvantages

1. Introduces a dependency between services 
2. If any inter-service request fails, the overall request fails
3. The entire request is only as fast as the slowest request
4. Can easily introduce web of requests
