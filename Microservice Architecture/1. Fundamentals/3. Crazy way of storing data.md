Just like the database-per-service pattern, async communication is going to seem _bizarre and inefficient_

Refine the requirements of Service D: 
> Code to show products ordered by a particular user

Refined: 
> Given the ID of a user, show the title and image for every product they have ever ordered

### Database Required For Service D

### Overall architecture (With Event Bus)

Each time Service A, B or C get a request, they make changes in their database and simultaneously emit an event on the Event bus. This event is listened by Service D and it make changes in its own Database accordingly. 

For Example: User comes to sign up -> Save to DB -> Emit event -> Service D receives event -> make an entry of userId in the Users Table

### Benefits
Service D has zero dependencies on other services!
Service D will be extremely fast!

### Downsides
Data duplication
Harder to understand

### Pricing
$14 for storing 100 million amazon products. Size of one product as json in 1250 bytes. Data is relatively free.
