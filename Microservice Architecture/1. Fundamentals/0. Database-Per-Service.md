Database-Per-Service architecture, also known as the Database-Per-Service pattern, is an architectural approach used in microservice architectures where each microservice has its own dedicated database. Instead of sharing a single monolithic database, each service maintains its own isolated and independent database.

In the Database-Per-Service architecture:

1. Data autonomy
2. Service boundaries
3. Independent development and deployment
4. Scalability and performance
5. Security and data privacy
6. Polyglot persistence

However, it's important to note that the Database-Per-Service architecture also comes with certain challenges:

1. Data consistency
2. Data duplication and redundancy
3. Cross-service querying
4. Distributed transactions
5. Data migration and versioning
