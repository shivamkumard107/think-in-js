In the context of the Express framework, **middlewares are functions** that have access to the request object (**req**), response object (**res**), and the **next middleware function** in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can modify the request and response objects, execute any code, and then pass the control to the next middleware function in the stack by calling the `next()` function.

Middlewares are a powerful feature of Express that enable developers to modularize their application logic into smaller, reusable functions that can be used across different routes and applications. Some **common use cases for middleware functions** in Express include:
1.  **Logging**: Middleware functions can be used to log information about incoming requests and outgoing responses, including request method, URL, status code, and response time.
2.  **Authentication and authorization**: Middleware functions can be used to authenticate users, check their permissions, and enforce access control policies.
3.  **Error handling**: Middleware functions can be used to handle errors that occur during request processing, such as invalid requests, database errors, or network timeouts.
4.  **Request processing**: Middleware functions can be used to process and manipulate incoming requests, such as parsing request body, setting headers, or validating input data.

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// Middleware function to log incoming requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Incoming request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`)
  next() // Pass control to the next middleware function
})

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!')
})

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000')
})
```

Overall, middleware functions in Express provide a flexible and extensible way to handle common application concerns and add additional functionality to your application.
