An Object Document Mapper (ODM) is a software component or library that **maps data between an object-oriented programming language and a NoSQL database** system that uses documents for data storage. 

ODMs are used to simplify the development process by abstracting away the low-level details of database interaction and providing a higher-level interface that developers can use to work with their data.

One example of an ODM is **[[Mongoose]]**, which is used with MongoDB. Mongoose provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with MongoDB from a Node.js application. It allows developers to define their data models as JavaScript classes, which are then mapped to MongoDB collections. Mongoose provides a rich set of features for working with data, including support for validation, middleware, and querying.

Other examples of ODMs include Morphia for MongoDB in Java, Mongoid for MongoDB in Ruby, and Doctrine for MongoDB in PHP.
