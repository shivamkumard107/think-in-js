Suppose you have a database of blog posts, and you want to store comments for each post as embedded documents. You could define a schema like this:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');  

const commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({   
	author: String,   
	text: String,   
	date: { type: Date, default: Date.now } 
});  

const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({   
	title: String,   
	content: String,   
	comments: [commentSchema] 
});  
const Post = mongoose.model('Post', postSchema);
```

In this example, we define two schemas: `commentSchema` and `postSchema`. The `commentSchema` defines the structure of a comment document, with fields for the author, text, and date. The `date` field uses the `Date` type and defaults to the current date and time.

The `postSchema` defines the structure of a post document, with fields for the title, content, and an array of embedded comments. The `comments` field is an array of documents that conform to the `commentSchema`. Each comment document will be embedded inside a post document, so that all comments for a given post can be retrieved in a single query.

To create a new post with comments, you could do something like this:

javascript

```js
const newPost = new Post({
  title: "My First Blog Post",
  content: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...",
  comments: [{ author: "Alice", text: "Great post!" },
  { author: "Bob", text: "Thanks for sharing!" }]
});

newPost.save((err, post) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
  else { console.log(post); }
});
```

In this example, we create a new `Post` instance and specify the title, content, and two comments. We then call the `save` method to save the post to the database. The resulting post document will have an `_id` field generated by MongoDB, along with the specified fields and embedded comments.
