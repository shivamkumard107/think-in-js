Pagination is a common requirement when working with large datasets. Mongoose provides several methods to implement pagination, including the `skip()` and `limit()` methods.

Here's an example of how you can implement pagination using `skip()` and `limit()` in Mongoose:

```js
const pageSize = 10; // Number of documents per page
const pageNumber = 1; // Current page number

// Find all documents, skip the documents that belong to previous pages and limit the number of documents per page
const documents = await MyModel.find().skip((pageNumber - 1) * pageSize).limit(pageSize);

// Get the total number of documents
const totalDocuments = await MyModel.countDocuments();

// Calculate the total number of pages
const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalDocuments / pageSize);

```

In this example, we first define the number of documents per page (`pageSize`) and the current page number (`pageNumber`). We then use the `skip()` method to skip the documents that belong to previous pages and the `limit()` method to limit the number of documents per page.

Finally, we use the `countDocuments()` method to get the total number of documents and calculate the total number of pages by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents per page and rounding up using the `Math.ceil()` method.

Note that the `skip()` and `limit()` methods should be used with caution when working with large datasets, as they can have performance implications. In such cases, it may be more efficient to use cursor-based pagination or other pagination techniques.
