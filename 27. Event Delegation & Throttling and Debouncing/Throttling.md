Throttling is a technique used in rate limiting to control the **rate at which events or actions are executed**. In JavaScript, throttling can be used to limit the rate at which functions are called. Here's an example of how throttling can be used for rate limiting:

```js
function throttle(fn, delay) {
  let lastCallTime = 0;
  return function(...args) {
    const currentTime = Date.now();
    if (currentTime - lastCallTime >= delay) {
      fn.apply(this, args);
      lastCallTime = currentTime;
    }
  };
}

const throttledFunc = throttle(makeRequest, 1000);

function makeRequest() {
  // Make the request
}

// Call the throttled function
throttledFunc();
```

In this example, the throttle() function takes a function and a delay as arguments. It returns a new function that can be called to execute the original function, but only at a limited rate specified by the delay argument.

The lastCallTime variable keeps track of the time when the function was last called. When the throttled function is called, it checks whether the elapsed time since the last call is greater than or equal to the delay. If it is, the original function is called with the provided arguments and the lastCallTime variable is updated. If the elapsed time is less than the delay, the function is not executed.

In this example, the makeRequest() function is called through the throttledFunc variable, which is created by passing the makeRequest function and a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to the throttle() function. This ensures that the makeRequest() function is called at most once per second, effectively throttling the rate of requests being made.
